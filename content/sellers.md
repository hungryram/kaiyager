As a smart seller there are 3 things you need to know before selling your property.

1. **Pricing**

Pricing is the single most important factor when it comes to selling your home. Before we go into how to price your home properly there is one key factor that a seller must understand. This KEY TIP is that the first 2 weeks your home is on the market is the most important time. During this time, you will receive the most exposure, attraction, and showings. It is important to price the home properly during this time, if you don’t you will miss out on the sweet spot and ultimately reduce your chances of selling your home for top dollar.

* Pricing your property competitively will generate the most activity. Price it too high and you will miss out on the sweet spot to sell resulting in less activity, less competition, less money! You will have to reduce the price possibly below market value to compete with fresh new, well priced listings.
* The value of your property is determined by what a buyer is willing to pay and what a seller is willing to accept.
* Buyer’s make their decision by seeing what comparable properties sold in the neighborhood for.
* Listen to what the Market is telling you.
* 10 Days without Showing – Home is Overpriced. At least 5% overpriced.
* 10 Days without an Offer – Property Rejection – 3-5% Overpriced.
  2. **How to Prepare Your Home to be Sold for Top Dollar**


* Buyer’s normally see the front of the house first. Make a lasting first impression by having a well maintained lawn/shrubs, decluttered porch, clean windows, rails, steps, gutters, garage exterior, pool free of debris and fresh paint if needed.
* Clean/Declutter the House! A few hours a day can go a long way when trying to get top dollar. Not every buyer can imagine how a clean home will look. By putting in some work you guarantee yourself the best chance to have your home sell.
* Clean walls, dust and repair moldings, patch holes.
* Clean floors and vacuum/shampoo carpets.
* Remove any unpleasant odors.
* Repair any Leaks, sticky doors, windows, or bulbs. If you have any plumbing leaks, doors that stick when trying to open, or burned out bulbs that keep prospects in the dark… These will have a lasting impression on a buyer’s mind.
* Bathrooms sell homes! Make sure bathrooms are presentable by removing clutter off counters, repair caulking, and showcasing with towels and bathmats.
* Light! During the day open up all the blinds and let the natural light pour into the home. At night, turn on all the lights inside and out. This will give prospects a more welcoming approach.
  3. **Staging**

Staging is the final step for preparation. It’s not absolutely needed but it has been proven that staging your home will get your home sold faster. If you have a vacant property, staging the home can leave a lasting impression on a prospective buyer. Staging will allow the buyer to envision property as if it was a home they can see themselves in. Not everyone has an imagination and staging helps prospects grasp the idea of the space the home offers.
