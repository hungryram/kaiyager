testimonial = "Yumi is the most reliable, responsive and dedicated real estate agent you can think of! We sent her the first message one Sunday afternoon on the way to the open house we wanted to check, which she responded immediately, and an hour after that we were having the first meeting. We were lucky enough to find our dream house soon after the meeting and Yumi represented us as a buyer's agent. Based on her experience and the information she gathered from the seller's agent, she gave us precise advice/strategy on how to make our offer. Thanks to that, our offer was accepted among multiple competitive offers. All of the escrow process went just smooth since she had made a good relationship with the seller's agent. We highly recommend her!"

testimonial = "My name is Reiko Tamura, I am a real estate investor. My partner and I have been investing in real estate over 15 years. We conduct our business very seriously and professionally, and our expectations are high. This was our first time to work with Ms. Yumi Yager and Mr. Kai Yager. But, Yumi and Kai exceeded our expectations and sold our house in a matter of one weekend with over 15 offers. Toward the end, actually my partner and I had to ask them to stop accepting offers because there were too many offers – good offers. What they were great at was their preparations and marketing. As you know, first thing for everyone to do is to determine how much we are going to ask for the house. Asking Price is the key factor to be successful in real estate business – cannot be too high and cannot be too low. Yumi and Kai brought 5 -6 comps with them, analyzed and explained each one of them to us, and sure enough the Asking Price they came up with and what we were in our minds were exactly the same. That was impressive. Once we determined the price, they put our house not only on MLS listing site, but on Social Media Marketing sites, sent out physical post cards to the neighbors, and had a Broker Open House before our official Open House. They are professional and hard workers. They are also responsible and honest with good heart. Those are the skills all the real estate agents should have, and sure they do. I have no hesitation to recommend both Ms. Yumi Yager and Mr. Kai Yager as your next real estate agent!! You will be in great hands like we were!!! Sincerely, Reiko Tamura"

testimonial = "Kai was super helpful in helping us purchase a property. He somehow was able to schedule viewings for 4 houses back-to-back, making our viewing process very effective and efficient. He gave his honest, unbiased opinion on every house, helping us make our decision rationally.  \nWhen we decided which properties we wanted to make offers on, he walked us through the offer process (how much to offer compared to the asking price, comparisons nearby, contingencies, etc.)-- this was super helpful.  \nKai was able to help us negotiate with the seller more than we expected regarding repairs. He easily saved us a couple thousand dollars here.  \n  \nOverall, Kai was able to guide us throughout our home-buying process without any complications.  \n  \nTLDR: Kai is one of the best agents around. He will take care of you :)"

testimonial = "Yumi was an absolute godsend. I have recently had the displeasure of dealing with a number of unresponsive realtors in other parts of the country, and that makes me appreciate Yumi even more. I was having great difficulty moving forward with a transaction. After numerous conversations, Yumi was very aware of my thought process and knew what needed to be done to accomplish my goals. She carefully explained my options and helped me understand the best solution. Yumi listened, understood, had empathy, and was able to put a plan in place. She then continually touched base to ensure all my questions were answered and guided me through every step. Yumi was always available by phone, text, or email and flexible in arranging meetings. My thought is that whether it is a large or small transaction, it could mean everything to the person involved. Whatever your situation, it would be worth having a conversation with Yumi to see if she is the person who can make things happen for you. I believe that, as in my case, she will develop a relationship through understanding what is important to you so that she can provide you with personalized service. Yumi treated me with respect and kept to her word. I will forever be grateful to Yumi."

testimonial = "Met Kai through a family member's recommendation. After our first conversation, he made us feel conformable enough to become first time home buyers and assured us that he would be guiding us through the process. Sure enough, any concerns that arose, he took it upon himself to provide us the most thorough answer and provided us different perspectives that wouldn't otherwise have been considered due to our lack of experience. After his first battery of questions to familiarize himself with what we were looking for, he took it upon himself to make sure he provided us with plenty of options that were available on the market for us to carefully consider. Thanks to his diligence the process of buying a home was made easier and we have to attribute that to Kai's efforts."
