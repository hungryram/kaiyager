Where it all started, Central Torrance is the center of Old Town Torrance. Old Town Torrance is one of the most historic sections of Torrance with homes over 100 years old. Historic architecture can be seen in homes and buildings all over Old Town Torrance. A great example of this is Torrance High School and its Revival Renaissance Architecture. A few famous films were filmed at Torrance High which include: Bruce Almighty, Not Another Teen Movie, Sheâ€™s All That, 90210, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

Featuring one of the biggest parks in Torrance, Wilson Park offers the community a rec center, Tree house, basketball courts, baseball field, and so much more. Also in the center of Central Torrance are large gated communities such as La Terraza, Windmiere, and Chatelaine.
