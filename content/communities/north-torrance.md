Welcome to North Torrance, home of the North High School Saxons. North Torrance offers many nice suburban neighborhoods with close access to the 405 freeway. The people in North Torrance are cultured and diverse. One North Torrance spotlight is the Roadium which is an outdoor flea market/open air market. Also home to Toyota USA Automobile Museum, it’s a great place to see Toyota’s history of their sports and collector vehicles and how it influenced the automobile industry. With heavy Japanese roots, you will notice many Japanese supermarkets and restaurants throughout North Torrance like Nijiya and Marukai (Tokyo Central). North Torrance is the smallest section in Torrance but offers a close knit community where the people look after eachother.
