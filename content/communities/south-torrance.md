Welcome to South Torrance

South Torrance offers the beachy suburban lifestyle. The residents are active, friendly, pleasant, and love soaking up the sun. Home to sandy Torrance Beach, what better way than to spend a summer weekend at the beach. Beautiful ocean breezes are the norm and the tranquil serenity in the South Torrance neighborhoods are highly sought after. A great highlight of South Torrance are the Seaside Holiday Lights. A tradition every year where we see the most glorious Christmas lights in Seaside Ranchos right off of PCH, west of Calle Mayor.
