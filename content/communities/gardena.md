Welcome to Gardena, the cultural capital of the South Bay. Gardena is most known for the immense diversity of foods and restaurants. If you want a different taste for every day of the week, you can find that in Gardena. South of Los Angeles, Gardena is a neighborly suburban area known for many of their mom and pop shops. Gardena mostly consists of Single Family Residence homes but developers have recently come in and built small gated communities. There are a number of communities that have given homebuyers a variety of options in Gardena. One of the more affordable areas of the South Bay, Gardena continues to rise in prices and value.

One of Gardenaâ€™s highlights is the Roadium Open Air Market which is a Flea market that can make your weekend fun with some Deal hunting. Along with the flea market, The Roadium has drive-in movie nights where you can watch classic movies from the comfort of your car. Right down the street is Pacific Square Shopping Center which is a plaza filled with Japanese culture. These are just some of the cultural spaces of Gardena.
