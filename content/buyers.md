Purchasing a home is one of the biggest financial decision of one’s life. Whether you are a first time home buyer or an experienced one, you must be careful and 100% committed before putting in an offer.

##### Why Do You Want to Buy?

A good question to ask yourself is why. Are you sick of paying rent for someone else’s mortgage? Have you outgrown your home? Have your kids moved out and you need a smaller home? Are you looking for an investment property to add to your portfolio? Do you want a shorter commute? Understanding the why will tap into your motivation and desire.

How to Find Your Ideal Home?

This list will allow you to choose and fixate on the right property when you see it. Communicating with your agent to discuss this list of wants and needs will an agent to hone in on your ideal home. Communication is key during this step which leads into the next category.

##### How to Make a Strong and Appealing Offer?

Consult with your agent to discuss a competitive price depending on what’s on the offer table.

Create a personal letter to the sellers to explain why their home is the perfect fit for you and your family. Create a personable bond between you and the seller.

Be patient. Do not consistently bombard the agent and sellers asking for their response. This is a big decision for the sellers.

In a multiple offer situation, go in with your best. Many agents and sellers will respect a buyer who goes in with their best offer. At times, sellers will not send out counter offers and will select the best offer. Submit your best offer for your number one choice to eliminate any doubt or regret. Buyers always assume that counters will be submitted and try to undercut the competition. It almost always never works and you end up missing out on your number one option.

If you get outbid, do not get discouraged. This is part of the home buying process. It is important to consult with an experienced agent who knows how to format an offer to stand out from the bunch.
